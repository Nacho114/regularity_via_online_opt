# Proving regularity lemmas via online optimization

Master semester project at EPFL done under the supervision of Prof. Juhan Aru.


Szemerediâ€™s regularity lemma is a fundamental result in graph theory, in this work we revisit proofs of the lemma that are done via methods borrowed from online optimisation. We will try to give an intuition of why the particular method from online optimisation might be well suited for this problem.
